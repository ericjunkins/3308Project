Vision Statement: Easy access to remote control devices from mobile devices. 

Motivation: Fun and convenient alternative to leisure activity that already exists. 

Risks: 
  Working enviorment - No one has written phone apps before, or Java either.
  Unfamiliarity with communicating with hardware devices on a base coding level.

Mitigation Stragety:
  Consult with known/familiar industry professionals about writing mobile apps to communicat with wireless devices.
  Andriod Studio/Java tutorials and learning exercise

List of Requirements:
  6 User Stories
  
    As a user I want to be able to remotely turn on and off the device for the conveinence of having controls all in one place.
        Size: ~6hr

        Size: ~4hr
    As a user I want to be able to know how much battery life is left on my RC device 
        Size: ~6hr
    As a developer I want to be able to translate sensitivty of joystick movement from app to movement of the device
        Size: ~8hr
  
  
Metholodogy: Agile, plan to work in small incrimenets in which at the end of we have a working product that fufills that stages processes
