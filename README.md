Title: Remote Control Phone App

Description: Write a mobile App to be able to control devices through wireless signal. The exact devices are not determined yet, but ideas include battery operated RC cars, and other robotic devices.

Vision Statement: Easy access to remote control devices from mobile devices. 

Motivation: Fun and convenient alternative to leisure activity that already exists. 

Risks: 
  Working enviorment - No one has written phone apps before, or Java either.
  Unfamiliarity with communicating with hardware devices on a base coding level.

Mitigation Stragety:
  Consult with known/familiar industry professionals about writing mobile apps to communicat with wireless devices.
  Andriod Studio/Java tutorials and learning exercise
